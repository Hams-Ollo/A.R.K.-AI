## Progress Update - Initial Implementation
Date: 2024-12-16

### Completed Tasks
1. Created project structure with directories for backend, frontend, tests, and documentation
2. Set up initial dependencies in requirements.txt
3. Implemented core backend components:
   - Database models for documents and chunks
   - Database configuration with PostgreSQL
   - Document processing pipeline with PDF support
4. Created Streamlit frontend:
   - Home dashboard with statistics and quick actions
   - Upload page with metadata input
   - Search page with filters and result display

### Next Steps
1. Set up PostgreSQL database and implement migrations
2. Connect frontend to backend API
3. Implement document processing with Groq LLaMA integration
4. Add unit tests for core functionality
5. Set up Docker configuration for development

### Technical Notes
- Using pgvector for efficient vector similarity search
- Implemented chunking strategy with 1000-token chunks and 200-token overlap
- Storing embeddings as base64-encoded strings in PostgreSQL
- Using Streamlit session state for managing upload state

## Next Steps
1. Set up Python virtual environment and dependencies
2. Create initial database schemas for document metadata
3. Implement document ingestion pipeline
4. Develop basic Streamlit interface

## Current Focus
Setting up the development environment and implementing the document ingestion system.
